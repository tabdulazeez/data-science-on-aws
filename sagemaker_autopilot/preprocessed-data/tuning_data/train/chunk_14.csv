-1,This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
1,These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
1,Super soft  light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.
1,This is a lovely blouse. it has an empire waist type cut  which camouflages tummy and hips nicely (especially after a large holiday meal!). i'm usually between a small and medium (4-6) and didn't really notice much of a different between the two sizes.  **note: it does not come with the camisole shown in the photo  but any black or white standard camisole would work.
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0."
1,I agree with other reviewers that this top runs large - i'm glad i ordered a size down. it's a cute twist on a basic tee shirt.
0,"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted "
-1,"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl"
0,I ordered this and didn't even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just wasn't what i was looking for as far as color. also  the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well  thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a
-1,I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.
-1,....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad  sad  sack. the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me.
0,Low waisted  weird liner.
0,I'm tall and small chested so the dress didn't fit me perfectly. i adore the color and pattern  but wish it was less revealing in the chest area. i definitely have to wear something under. otherwise high quality and unique dress!
1,I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes  polka dots and sweet flowers.
0,Cute but too thick and rough
-1,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
-1,This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d  and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately  this top will be going back.
0,I should have exchanged it for a smaller size  but i wanted to wear it  so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14  and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this  size down for sure.
0,I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
0,Great style but not so great quality:(  stone fell off right away.  but they still look great
1,I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now  they look good with the legs rolled up or down  and i will be wear
1,Dress is darling and well made. however  it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
-1,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.
0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
1,I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars  yes  this top is for a strapless bra  my bra top (where the strap starts  0 was showing  but so nice... shape was ok for me  it does go in at the hem  givinng a bubble-like shape  but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps  but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store  but checked  and yes  that's true... love it.    not an online exclusive  as it was in my store  i pur
-1,"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however  being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back."
-1,Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
-1,I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay"
1,I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
-1,The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
1,I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless
0,I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.
1,I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone  with leggings  or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.
-1,I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!
1,I love this top! i ordered the print  and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans  and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews  and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.
-1,I love byron lars dresses  and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is  sadly  going back today.
-1,This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
-1,"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
1,I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!
-1,I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
-1,I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
1,This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck  but i assume that will get easier with time.
0,I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size  i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy  at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops  the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.
1,I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish  soft and very comfortable.
-1,I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy  poor quality for the price.
0,Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
0,I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.
1,"Really pretty for summer  especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top  so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on  and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it  since it's really pretty for a summer party."
0,Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
-1,I've been shopping at retailer since 2007  and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.   1. it is long on her  not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance.  2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above.  3. in the picture  t
-1,While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.   also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium @ retailer  but i have a sm
1,Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious  i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
-1,I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort  it wasn't for me.
-1,I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.
0,Just received two  the red and the black. the black is a great print  very versatile. both run large  but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area  but (barely) covers my bra.    the material is somewhat thinner than expected  but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.
0,I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
1,This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area  but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!
-1,The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
1,Super cute and comfortable! soft fabric drapes nicely. i wear this with an orange skirt  white shirts or jeans. i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected! i'm so glad i tried it on! a nice surprise.
0,The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
1,I normally wear a 4  and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated  my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..
0,This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size  and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
-1,This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures  i had high hopes  but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say  it's going back!
1,I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!
1,I love how soft  and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.
1,Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
0,This is a cute  flattering dress  however the drop-waist  the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant  mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.    my big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee
0,"Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4"" too long. i am 5'8"" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants."
1,I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.
0,This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small  but it was still gigantic.
0,This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat
