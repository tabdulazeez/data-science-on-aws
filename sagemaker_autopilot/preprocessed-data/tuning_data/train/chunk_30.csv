-1,I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l  this would have looked like a maternity top on me.
0,I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.
-1,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
1,I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect  a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo
0,But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.
0,This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however  the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.
1,Really cute top  comfy  with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit  or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact  maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle  but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large  but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
1,Love this sweater! not too long or bulky true to size. the fabric is super soft  great quality!
1,This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
-1,I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
-1,I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress  the silhouette  the flouncy skirt; however  i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy  dark colors.
0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.
-1,"I'm 5' 5""  150 lbs  32dd  normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast."
1,Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!
0,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that
1,I am 5'3  120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title  the material is quite heavy and great quality  which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!
0,"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however  i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse  it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it."
0,I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up  a size 6 instead of my usual 4  and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately  the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress  i'm not denying that  but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a
-1,"I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!"
-1,I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came  i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
-1,This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
-1,"When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself ""hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep  that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning."
1,I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!
-1,It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
-1,I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.
0,This top is lovely  but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.
-1,This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
0,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top."
0,I ordered this in tan and white  but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent  i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
0,"I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny  which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway  the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top  and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where"
1,I like the soft green color  the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.
-1,I am of average height  but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print  but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!
-1,I wanted to love this top. but  it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful  but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.
0,The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
0,Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa
1,The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size  figure flattering  and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece  this is it!
1,I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close  and i realized it was better than i thought. however  i didn't have time to try it on.    it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und
0,"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!"
0,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.
-1,I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...
-1,"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de"
1,I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy  but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.
0,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful"
-1,This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist
1,Fits a bit on the bigger side  but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
1,I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully  they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know  so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.
0,It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
0,I loved the idea of this dress  but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting  but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft  but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.
1,I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
1,Fit and flare  pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
1,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!
1,I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors.     i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine  then line drying. i have done this for years with al
0,I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
-1,I loved the cut and style of this shirt  so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it  get it in a size larger.
0,I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried
1,This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
1,I tried on a regular size at the store  and definitely need petite (5'1.5'  115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale  and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot  where hte muscles meet. there is alining  so not see-through. length was too long  why i need petie  also loose-fitting  i would like it more a little more fitted  jsut a bit.
1,This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique  adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work  party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.
1,Love the pattern  i thought i would be hosed and need a petite  but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side  so great for summer (office is cooold)  love subtle squares  glad they still had my size at sale! :-)
0,I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
1,As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it  and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back  has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings  but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights  but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com
0,I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.
-1,I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size)  i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy. disappoin
1,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5""  120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it."
-1,This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.
-1,... for the model to look like this? pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip. cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin
-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.
1,This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it  the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
