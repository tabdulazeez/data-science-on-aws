1,It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's  especially in this fabric  keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size  i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well  they stretch out a little  so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange  green  or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
1,Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.
0,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
-1,Ordered this top online  as i loved the colors and design  but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m  and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide  not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
-1,I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however  in person  it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
-1,This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit  if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't
1,"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t"
-1,I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
1,Beautiful color  great quality! on sale too. a must have!
0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
-1,I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
1,This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain  long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light  so it is for fall or spring.
1,"I ordered the black 2 months ago  it was on back order  and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft  itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low  so most people do need a cami underneath  but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style  but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts  deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color  not sure  but love this one in black for sure@"
0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
0,"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it  just a bit disappointed."
0,These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b
0,Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft  cute design but not flattering. returning
0,Yummy  soft material  but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like  then this is for you.
1,I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up  i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it  a slight sheen  and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be  but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
1,This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
1,"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it  even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small"
0,This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
1,Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!
-1,I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
-1,"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look  it just was terrible on me. i'm petite  5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
-1,The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
1,The color is a very soft peach  and the knit top over the gauze is a very light  summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual  or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
1,I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style  it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist  just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d  135#  38-28-35.
0,This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
-1,Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.
1,This dress rules.  so comfy  and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats  wedges  booties  boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either  i am a 34c.
0,I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.
1,Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size 4 regular  or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p  but it's no longer available.
1,Sorry  but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing  i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy  and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline  and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm
1,I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review  it runs large in the armholes and across the bust  which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit  so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however  i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said  the detailing i
-1,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
-1,Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
0,I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
1,Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.
1,This top was very pretty when i got it  but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice  and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.
0,It's a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans  if can even be dressed up. however  i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it's a very cute design  it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate  i've gotten many compliments on it! order a size up  i am normally a small but the medium worked be
0,"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however  the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5""  125#  34c)  but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally  the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l"
1,This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!
-1,I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
0,"While i loved the material  color and concept of the dress  it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2"" and 108 lbs  pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right  it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly  this will be going back."
0,"I didn't realize when i ordered  that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look  especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist  rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7"" and i do like fuller skirts  but was"
0,Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
-1,I purchased this top in the black and tan color  loved the fit  style and fabric. however  it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front  which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
-1,Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good  but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason.
1,Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats  boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9  138 with an athletic build.
0,I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
-1,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
-1,Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.
-1,Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.
0,Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
1,Girls  this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup  there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down  so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas  i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
-1,The sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back.
-1,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(
0,This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
0,This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price  but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest  but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest  so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
1,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4"" hourglass shape (32d  27 inch waist  size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a 4 regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee)  so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in"
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.
1,"Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress  but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for  itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") ."
-1,I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
-1,I saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.
0,So i thought this sweater would be snowy white  but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive  i do like it  just because it is not snowy white like i thought  it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
1,I ordered the green  black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition.
-1,"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft."
