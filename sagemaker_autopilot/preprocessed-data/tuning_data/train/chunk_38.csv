-1,Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
0,The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.
0,I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.
0,I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details  especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite  i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w
-1,I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.
1,I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it  it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!
-1,I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
-1,This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size  typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed  small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on. too bad  but it went back
1,I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.
1,I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me  i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist  but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too  and didn't gap.
0,"I coveted this dress for so long  but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined  and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on  it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress  though  is the shiny  sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s"
1,This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.
-1,I don't normally review my purchases  but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made  i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made  good quality dress for the high price tag.
1,Warm  cozy  can dress down/up  and is perfect for traveling. a great staple. as other people noted  the dress (if you buy your regular size) is a little more fitted than it looks on the model. size up if you prefer it to hang looser.
1,"Beautiful dress  skims the body perfectly and flatters. the silky and breathable fabric is everything-- it's made of cupro (used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton-- uniqlo uses it in their ""airism"" products which makes it perfect for summer weather!). i wore it to a summer barbecue  dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry  but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry. it's gorgeous-- get it!       the colors of the fabric a"
0,I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.
-1,When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture  but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier  but not what i envisioned. t
0,"I am 5' 4 1/2""  125 lbs.  and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also  i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color  but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online."
0,This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
0,The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women  but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large  even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed  as i loved it in every other way.
0,I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however  the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus  it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.
-1,These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
0,"This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6"". i'm 5'9"" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it."
-1,These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand  mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever  i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
-1,I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.
0,I really wanted to like his dress  but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts  so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall  it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.
0,I got the red  which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute  but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return  but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)
-1,I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
1,I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side  but i'm all about the flow these days. oh  and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece.
0,This sweater is really cute  great fit and unique style. unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like. not the right shade for my skin tone.
1,"This is a really elegant sweater coat--the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the ""mismatching"" color blocks on each side keeps things playful. the material is soft and cozy  but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged. otherwise  though  it's a winner!"
1,"I love this top! although  i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home."
1,"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color  size l (my usual size  i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy  but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase."
1,I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store  but it's usually from a return.
-1,This top looks beautiful online. when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back
1,I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine  without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist  but it's still very flattering.
1,"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide  but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color  which is more green and has very faint stripes. very"
1,I consider myself fairly busty (34 d)  but i didn't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium.....i actually went with the small. the lace inset doesn't give  but it wasn't tight at all. i love the flow of the blouse....it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall!
1,"Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it"
-1,This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
0,This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
1,I thought this shirt was really interesting online and it doesn't disappoint in person. i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher. overall though this was a great find and i know i'll wear it again and again.
0,This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
-1,I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also  didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
-1,I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece  and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear  but for me  there were a few challenges.    first  the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style  cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
0,"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4""  120 lbs and tried a size s."
0,I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug  but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.
1,This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.
0,So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.
-1,This is a cute dress  but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small  2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame  this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller  thinner people. unfortunately  mine is going back.
0,This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.  i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....  the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.  and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress  cocktail party or date night. the top de
0,I love the style of this dress  but unfortunately  it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also  the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.
1,This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater. i found it to run large  so thankfully i ordered one size down  which was perfect. i'm normally xs  but the xxs was very flattering  still loose and casual  but fitted in the waist and arms. it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame. the regular was fine  but a petite would probably be great. the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail. the cowl is nice  not too overwhelming. this is so soft and
-1,I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.
1,Purchased this t-shirt in white. it's lightweight and slightly sheer. perfect for layering. looks cute with a poncho  blazer or on it's own. really wish it was available in black.
-1,Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good
-1,The top is cute  but when i received it  it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side  the return was no problem.
1,I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print  i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.
1,"Maeve does not disappoint! unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy  a bit shapeless  and not form-fitting  this hugs all the right curves. it's adorable  eye-catching and the pattern is so cute. i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket - so fun. just like the wynwood top in all 4 colors  the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched. it's tts. i am 5'4"" 115 and got the 2. thank you  retailer & thank you  maeve!"
0,I am 5'8 with curvy  muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.
-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
1,But when i saw this top in person  urged by my stylist when they got it in  i decided to try it on. they had xs in store  my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look  and not sure if smaller would work  i decided to order all three: xxs  xsp and xxsp!    verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes  kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right  but arm holes were a little high  not as comfortable.  xsp ended up being the right c
1,"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy  and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however  this pair exceeded all my expectations! first  they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is"
-1,This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
0,I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
-1,When i read car coat  i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin  long blazer. also  the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe  so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected  so it will be a return.
-1,I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe
0,This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.
-1,I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
0,I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
