0,Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small  particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium  which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern.
0,"The skirt is very pretty  but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference  i'm 5'7"" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price  i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times  then decide."
1,Great arm coverage  soft material  flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.
1,The lengths is what drew me to this top. i love the simple look of the cowl neck. nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look.
0,This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
-1,"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9""  it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.  also  it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.  too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking."
1,I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on  and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top  cropped jeans  and sandals.
1,What a special skirt. so beautiful  great quality. i got on sale  but still expensive . . and it was still worth it. i will be wearing this for years!
-1,This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however  the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
0,"Beautiful detail  soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7"" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length."
0,I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.
1,In the photo i loved the colors. in person though  the print on mine had the four huge pink lily flowers on the front and it just wasn't the look i was hoping for  like the photo. also  i failed to notice in the photo that there's elastic along the seam of the butt! this seems silly and unnecessary.... it's not terribly noticeable on  but still i felt weird. the fabric is thick and not see-thru and the quality is fine  but the combination for the shifted print and the unexpected ruching and thes
0,I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.
0,This is a cute dress  but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup  anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
-1,I ordered this coat because  like others  i was taken by its feminine beauty! unfortunately  the coat showed up with the top button broken off (and missing) and another button hole torn open. i returned that coat right away  thinking that it'd been damaged somehow in shipping. however  i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button! when i tried on the coat  i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket. not the quality i expe
1,I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!
1,"This tank is really thin and airy without being too flowy. it was perfect for my soul cycle workout  and i am thinking about getting it in different colors for working out. i don't know that i'd normally wear this top on its own because it's very casual  but it's perfect as part of a workout or vacation outfit. i sized down one size to make sure that it wasn't too flowy  and it fit perfectly. i am 5'2"" and 130lbs.  and a size xs fit perfectly."
-1,I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh
0,"Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it."
1,The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape  bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
-1,I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.
1,Cute top  i actually got a lot of compliments on it.  the white is slightly see through  which doesn't bother me but could bother other people. all around cute casual piece.
1,While overall it's a pretty top  there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it  the top would be wide  longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown  the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some  as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off  and sewn  making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off  and the sleeve length is long with elastic
-1,This skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally  i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering.
1,A nice alternative to jeans  good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.
-1,"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7"""
-1,"I'm petite  and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy  the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here  but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall  not a great sweater."
-1,I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.
0,"If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips  the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you. ---------- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops  and went with the m  and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms  i would recommended sizing down a size. ---------- i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10"" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5"") rise jeans  then yes  you will"
0,"This is a cute dress  but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes  but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise  it was cute and simple  and the tulle was quite soft.  i think that i would have gone with a medium  but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference  i am 5'5""  ~135 lbs  34c  and 27"" waist."
-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~
-1,Based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however  the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.  they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo
0,"The shorts are very cute  very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1""  115 lbs. they are going back."
-1,"Again  nope. looks chic on the model  looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe"
-1,I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model  but it was a cropped length on me :(
1,I immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower  nice fabric and medium weight. nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo  great outfit. i am happy i ordered it  but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy  sleeves long. i am 5'6 medium build. small usually fits me well. i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back.
0,"Tried this lovely with high waste  wide leg  black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more  but not quite!    size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small  occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall  130 lbs  34d  35-29-37  long torso  narrow shoulders  and short arms.    fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t"
-1,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time
1,It is a pretty dress but runs large  i usually wear small and i ordered a regular xs because they are out of petite... it fits and since i am pregnant it works but it is a little large around the waist...  the lace is beautiful and the quality is amazing
0,I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual  paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner  plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect  though  is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon  which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li
-1,I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur
0,I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back  thin  silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .
0,Love the style  fabric and fit generally  but even ordering down a size  i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size  but not sure it will work as much as i want it to.
-1,"Tried this on at my local retailer  the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra  this is a deal-breaker for me  it can't be fixed."
1,"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref  5'8""  135 lbs  34-b)  but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is  and certainly lovely."
-1,"Love tiny. i am 5'7""  125-128 lbs depending on the day  and a 34a. i also have a very long torso  and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one  however  was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated  so it looked boxy on me. however  the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo  and then"
0,I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
1,Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top  i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.
1,"I had this on my wish list but saw it as a "" on of"" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale)  my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas"
1,Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.
0,The shape was not as nice on model  seemed like a lot of extra material.
1,Living a casual life style in key largo fl. i love a fitted t-shirt instead of a boxy shape. i'm 67 years and am very active and fit. love your store. classy
0,The fabric is really itchy  i felt like i was wearing a carpet  and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.
0,"The colors in the green shirt are beautiful  however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6"" 120#  not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall  wispy   less curves..."
0,This sweater is beautiful and well made  but i found the cut strange and unflattering. i ordered it in my usual size small  and it was too big in the shoulders and arms  with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms. but it just fit me in the chest  and would be too tight if i sized down. this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual.
1,Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!
1,These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
-1,I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure  and such a shame when th
0,This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.
0,"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p."
-1,This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric  it's very boxy  & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(
-1,I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however  when i received it  its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally  i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2  30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted  but its definitely not.
-1,I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?
-1,The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.
0,If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.
-1,I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i'll still need to return this top.
-1,I love this brand  i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap  reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin  and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath  you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black  and am keeping it only because i love the design  need a black top desperat
1,I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat  and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance  yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome  just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.
1,This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd  and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much  i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in  unlike most pencil dresses  and i cannot say enough about the color. wow  heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
0,Soft  stretch denim  70's fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this   but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27  my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn't zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won't have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area  . for full disclosure   i am a  size 36b  with broad shoulders and  a broad back
1,Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!
