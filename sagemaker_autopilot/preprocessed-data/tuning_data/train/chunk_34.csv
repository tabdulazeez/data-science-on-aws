0,This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
-1,This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
-1,I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.
1,I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length  too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.    rolls are not sewn on both ends  so you'll have to re-roll each wash.    wish you carried these basics at all times.
0,Two strikes against this top  and its going back. first  the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact  since i have tanks i could have worn  but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price  i wouldn't have expected b
0,As you can see  there is an array of differing opinions on here  and i share sentiments on both:  _______  pros:  - the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.  - tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight  it'll probably fit you like on the model.   - good length  not too short or too long.  - the mock collar is ni
1,This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said  it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style  so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.
0,I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
-1,I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
-1,Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so  i have bought 3 new pairs  and all have been so disappointing. first of all  the quality is horrible now. in the past  they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened  pilcro?!?!?
-1,This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts  but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.
-1,As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
-1,I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it  making it even harder to get off. it was returned.
1,They fit me great  are super comfortable. they are casual  yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online  too
1,Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!
-1,This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4  but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
0,I thought this top was so pretty and airy  but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
0,I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning
1,Tried this on and loved it! chic  lightweight  warm  cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!
1,I used to walk by this dress  thinking not much of it. but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for. tried it on. fell in love. tried on the 4 and 6 - went with the 4  runs tts. if the dress is too large  the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress. somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette. with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels  my valentine date fell for this dress too. he said it r
-1,This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top  like a dolman sleeve  but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top  which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
-1,I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!"
1,Very cute on  fits well. versatile top  i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.
1,This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow  but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine  especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric  but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally  the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!
-1,First of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said  it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c
1,I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming  and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters  with tights  boots  boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors  and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job  sparrow! btw  i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress)  and this one is just an inc
-1,I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
0,This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!
1,Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small  but the xsm worked better for me with this top.
0,I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c  127#. the moment i put it on  it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit  and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
-1,I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull  mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn  stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
-1,"Unfortunately this top is shirt-length  and i'm only 5'4"". needs to be about 6"" longer. made of sweatshirt material  which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller."
0,Love the color  but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms  the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
0,This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
1,Women who want some flutter without too much fullness
0,I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.
-1,I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine  but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips  so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.
-1,I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant!   for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.  the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one
1,The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it  but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color  but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue  and wanted it. however  for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it  and by the time i did  only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived  and as i was trying it on  i thought  this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something  but n
0,I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like
1,I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota  so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is  the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets  which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me  and i ordere
0,If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.
0,Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.
-1,This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...
0,"I ordered the geometric  blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately  it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting  bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference  i'm 5'4"" 120lbs 34 a."
1,This was a very nice sweater but i had to return because it came too late for a birthday gift i was giving. it also was not the sweater i had originally thought i had ordered. my mistake. it was very soft and would be suitable for any type of figure.
1,"First off  i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured  textured and substantial.  and for me  the xs fits perfectly  however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2""  110  24.5 waist  32.5 hips  and usually 00p-0p  and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite  this jumps"
1,This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy  cropped shirts  but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size  but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect  but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!
1,Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally  i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
1,I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package  it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful  the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.
-1,I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.
1,I usually wear an xs and in this i wore a small because on the bottom of the sleeve  it was tight. it's a great piece and i get a lot of compliments.
1,I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
-1,I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec
0,"I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3"" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs  not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got ""lost in the sauce"". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though."
0,Loved this top on model. even happier when it went on sale. sort of boxy. but still excited  then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric! disappointed. my other tees i purchased are fine.
-1,I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
-1,Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment 
0,"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off  it is scratchy""  so i didn't bother trying it on. it is  however  beautiful  if you are not sensitive to scratchy material. fit was true to size."
-1,This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know  it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my
0,Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.
1,Could not wait to try this on when it arrived  jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here  i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute  while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!
0,"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!"
0,I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant  but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
1,This cardigan is super soft and comfy with nice big pockets and an easy feel. i am glad i read the other reviews before i bought it  though. i usually wear an xl (and they are often too small)  but i ordered a large and even that one is a bit on the generous size. but i really like it a lot!
0,This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.
1,"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on  i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin  but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it  it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference  i am 5'2""  34b  120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase  and i can't wear it as a chemise  a coverup  or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!"
0,I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch  it's nice to have on hand  but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin  ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall  it's a comfortable piece  but it's more like a thin  long-sleeve t-shirt  rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
