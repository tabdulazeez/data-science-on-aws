-1,I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
-1,I bought this top and it ran huge  i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad  i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.
0,I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side  but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). i like the regular size because the l
1,"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further  i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small  i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for"
1,Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders  it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short  i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there  she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby 
0,The fabric felt beautiful  and it felt great on  but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
-1,Boxy  short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...
0,I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft  comfortable fabric  as other reviewers have mentioned  and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace  nothing sharp  pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.
1,I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable
-1,I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.
-1,This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
1,Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size  or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist.
-1,Unfortunately  does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
0,Nice dress  you can wash it  i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect    brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material.   material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving.   i will be returning it for that reason  too heavy for summer .
1,This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion  it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.
1,"Beautiful  feminine  flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of ""edge"". had to detach the slip to get it on  but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8""  135lbs  34d). can't wait to wear it!!"
-1,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.
0,Wanted to love this one so badly but didn't work for me. just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though!
0,This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be.
-1,I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room  the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well.     i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co
1,"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available  i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall  140#  36dd  28"" waist  35"" hips  wide"
0,I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly  the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo
0,Not that i don't recommend  only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird  no kidding  kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit  so perhaps they run small?    i would get petite if you are usually a petite  the regular size bunched on the bottom  too long.    i am usually a 0p or 00p  or
1,I absolutely love this sweater. it's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely. it's definitely more cropped (i'm 5'7)  but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt.     so cozy!
1,This dress i received is stylish  comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length  goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
1,"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."
0,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
-1,Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
1,These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down  which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
0,The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
1,I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted  but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there  so i think it's more of a night dress  but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.
-1,I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed. when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately  it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
0,Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit  but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall  winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f
0,I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.
-1,Like other reviewers have said  this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return.
-1,I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
1,The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
1,"I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that  so i ordered this one. fit is very similar. this one is made of a lightweight cotton  and has a similar cut. will be a great fall transitional jacket  and looks great with lots of things--maxi skirts  skinny jeans  long tops with the hems peaking out  etc. i found it tts: i got an xs and am 5'4""  120 lbs. i don't plan to wear more than a thin top underneath  but don't think i could fit a sweater under the sle"
0,Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.
1,Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.
-1,This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap  rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.
-1,Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!
1,For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical  i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on  but ultimately  i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen  which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through
0,The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at
0,First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin
-1,Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros  and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer  i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!
0,I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice  i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
1,"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee  not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!"
1,Very slimming  lovely dress.  a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.  the embroidery is lovely  fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly.   so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!
-1,Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.
0,The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo  my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,I hated to send this dress back  but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress. sent it back. it is meant for taller and more slender women.
0,I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.
1,I love  love these wide leg pants! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special. they are comfortable  and perfect. the length is great for wedges  and the fold over waist does not add bulk. the only downside  and this is probably due to my figure  but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat.
0,This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
1,"This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color  which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps  which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5""  110 lbs "
0,"What i liked:  1. midweight fabric. it's not lined and when i read polyester in the description  i was worried that it might be thin  but this is a stretchy midweight fabric.  2. pretty pretty print    what i did not like:  1. i don't know what dress the model is wearing  but this was an empire waist dress on me. i'm 5'7"". because it was empire waist  the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me.  2. the sleeves are cut oddly. they look too wide for the dress  even on this model.  3"
1,The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!
1,First of all i love retailer  i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.
0,"What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif.  no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned  for reference i'm 5'2"" 107 lbs average proportions."
-1,When i received this dress in the mail  i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style  although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress  his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.
-1,This looked like such a cute  casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said  it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on  i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
-1,"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall  it just doesn't work. also  i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh."
1,"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side."
0,"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size  but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee."
-1,These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it
0,Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
-1,The stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
-1,So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.
