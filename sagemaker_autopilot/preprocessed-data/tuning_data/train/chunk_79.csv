-1,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.
0,While the cut  drape  and shape of this dress are very attractive  seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however  the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly  thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.
0,The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.
1,This top is very cute. but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it. that is annoying.
-1,This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp
0,The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price  i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing  so i am debating whether i should keep or return.
0,I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is  unfortunately  more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well  but i bet it is lovely in navy.
0,I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
-1,I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.
0,I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top  and really wanted to like it  however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes  but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso  so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!
-1,Wore it a couple of times  it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.
1,I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine  just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...
0,"First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5"" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price."
-1,"I was so excited to try these  it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee."
-1,This is a beautiful skirt  but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.
1,Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.    i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.    i do wish they came in more colors.
-1,I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
1,The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
-1,I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.
-1,The material was thin  showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
0,I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
-1,"These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my ""go to"" pants  but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them  size down and suffer through the first few ""tight"" hours! trust me...they will"
1,Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already  so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big  so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.
-1,I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs  however  i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!"
0,Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.
1,I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s  so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it  however some women might be ok wearing it alone.
1,I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh
0,This is really cute online  but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder  but the material is very thin  and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.
1,Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight  it's back  and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made  can go from business to sport to casual.
0,"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7""  115lbs i prefe"
1,T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.
1,"I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a ""sweater."" just thick enough to hide any imperfections  panty lines  etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.    i'm 5'6'  135 lbs  34b and the small fit perfectly. i am ""pear - shaped"" by conventional standards  bu"
-1,This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.
-1,I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
-1,This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.
1,This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.  i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.  overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale  i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome.
1,These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.
1,I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short  so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit  but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge
-1,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.
1,I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist  but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
-1,The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering
0,I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co
1,Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down  which is hard to find too. perfect length  beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look
1,I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel  flats  sandals  booties  etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said  i plan on wearing this places where i won't be sitting for long periods of time because
1,I purchased this online and absolutely love this:::: it can be dressed up or down. i received many compliments  its also so soft and very comfortable!!! a must have!!
0,I loved the look of this shirt  but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.
0,This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
0,I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.
1,I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
-1,This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it. will be returning it.
-1,I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit  because
1,Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small  sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.
-1,I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff  silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.
1,These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.
0,Very nice material  soft and feminine colors. however  the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
0,I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.
-1,Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.
-1,Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!
1,I love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots. it's soft  comfortable  and loose fitting.
1,A beautiful classic!  love the denim fabric in such a pretty style.  this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics.  the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering.  ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly........very true to size.
1,These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however  i got the petite  because i am 5'3  and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle  just like the photo  however  they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever  so i am gonna deal with the length!!
0,This dress is a bit scratchy  but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair  the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene.     the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders  small chest and and slim.
0,I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
1,I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,For some reason  the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them  as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad.
-1,Too much fabric  not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
0,This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other  giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
