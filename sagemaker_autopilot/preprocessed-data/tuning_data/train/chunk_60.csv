1,Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.
0,This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
0,It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water  line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water
-1,"Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black  like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well  albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9"") and they run small. i sized up to a 6  when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out  sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them  and now they are good to go  but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first"
-1,I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.
0,I was excited to receive this top because i love the design  but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
1,Most of my jeans are ag. love the ankle length and wash on these. not too distressed either. tts. really soft denim! size 27 like my other ag's
-1,This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price  it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
0,I would have to wear a camisole underneath this  which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear  not something i'd have to layer.
-1,Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return  sadly.
-1,This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
0,First  i absolutely love this dress  and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended  and the dress fits perfectly. however  when i zipped the dress up  the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly  so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.
-1,Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
1,This is an attractive  fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look  great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer  but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo  i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans
1,I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually  they are much too short  this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too
1,This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.
0,The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price  i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.
1,Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality  beautiful design  flattering!
1,This is the softest  most perfectly cut basic. love the black  wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics  i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.
-1,"I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line  wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me  this jumpsuit was just"
1,This is a great  casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans.
0,Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
1,Beautiful flattering blouse
0,Super cute but order at least one size up
1,The colors  style and fit were great. this dress you could wear on many different occasions. all around great piece to own!
0,"I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5"") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in."
0,When i received this tank  i ordered the blue  i almost returned it because it seemed really thin  almost see through. however  once i tried it on it had a good fit  not see through  just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort  especially because it is on the thin side.
-1,The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.
1,Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
0,"I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6""  petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy."
1,This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large.   definitely recommend.
-1,This is cut very strangely  i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
1,The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.
0,I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.
-1,The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail
-1,First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a
0,I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store  i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole  but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home  it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design  cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.
1,I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out
0,Cute sweater  i really like the grey color. unfortunately  it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping  but even with a t-shirt underneath  i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back.
1,I am still on the fence with this one. i got it sort of as an impulse buy when i was buying some tops at my local store the other day. the piece is gorgeous and looks great over a black tank top. it is very versatile in that you can wear it so many different ways; as an accent piece over a t-shirt  bathing suit cover up  over a dress. it is a delicate material so i'm sure you have to be careful washing it  but it has a feminine  flowy style that is very unique. the only thing that i'm not sure o
-1,This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.
-1,The top fits nice  but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.
1,"I love these pants! for reference i am 5'1 1/2"" and 104lbs. so definitely petite. i ordered the extra small petite- way too long and huge around the hips.- i checked to see if maybe they sent the wrong size. hemming would not have been a problem and i even considered having them altered - but it would have been too difficult with the pockets and the pleats. unfortunately they do not come in xxs p so sadly they are going back. order a size down."
0,I have mixed feelings about htis top  it is a nice shape and comfortable  fits triue t o size  but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs  3-dd chest).
1,Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel  so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s  my typical size  which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.
-1,I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.
-1,The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.
1,The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.
1,The colors and textures on this top are fun. however  the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.
-1,I was really eager to receive this sweater  i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new  it is mostly shapeless  it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col
0,I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful  intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt  with the shirt getting wider and more
0,I tried this on in the store  and the fabric is lovely - so  so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric  so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.
0,This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.
1,I'm sad i was unable to get an xs  as the small is somewhat big on my 125-lb 5'6 frame. i'm keeping it for the sale price though! when i put it on in the store i got so many compliments from other customers who went to find it! i think it is meant to run large  and honestly i still think even with it looking big it still looked better in person than the model. i would recommend ordering it if you can and don't mind pieces that drape like this!
0,I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest  as the waist hits a bit high.  the color is vibrant...i wanted to like!
1,"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality  like as shown. i am 5'4""  120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews  but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust."
0,"Beautiful. got several compliments when wearing it. does not hold up with washes though. threads unraveling everywhere. i am thinking of returning it for this reason. fits true to size. i am 5'4"" 118 lbs  xs fit. i am smaller on top."
1,This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath  but i would be too warm.  in the store  several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run  i am returning the sweater.
1,This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.
-1,I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy  don't buy. however  if you want more of a fitted blouse feel  then go for it.
-1,I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f
-1,"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height."
-1,This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short  stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
0,This is a beautiful looking dress  but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4  112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked  even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress  and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
0,The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.
-1,"I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5'10"" frame than it falls on the model  between my belly button and hip  and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though  so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.  the quality of the knit seems nice  however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i"
0,I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.
-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea
-1,I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty  intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material  this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i
