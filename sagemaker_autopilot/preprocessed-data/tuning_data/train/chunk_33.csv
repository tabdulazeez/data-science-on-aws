1,The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.    very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!
1,I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful  and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous  but this one fits tts.     my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.
0,This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
-1,Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.
-1,"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this  but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
-1,Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!
0,This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small.   i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
0,Got this on sale in black and red  and have only worn the black. quality is poor  seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
1,This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile  will work for church or cocktail party. great purchase!
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.
0,The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top  lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for  and while i'm only around a b
1,I really like this top  a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.
1,"This dress makes me looks curvy thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5"" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!"
0,It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
0,This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l  if not a medium. sadly  it's going back :( otherwise  it's high quality and a beautiful design.
0,The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.
1,Love this dress  very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big."
1,"The pattern ""camouflages"" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft  great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out."
1,I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available  so can't compare there.    color: i liked the black better for these reasons:  1) color can be worn year-round  just add a nice jacket or cardigan  and ok for winter season.  2) ivory was kind of see-through    size: xxs fit me better  the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.    sadly  the xxs was the ivory  so i didn't keep either of them.    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in wasit
1,At first  i thought this sweater might be too boxy  but fastened at the waist  it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing  and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.  but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas  and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.
0,"Would recommend  but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over  even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips  usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned  plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow  the material is really nice  soft and comfy  color was good (i ordered the dark)  and i could imagine they would be super cute"
1,"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink  as shown. very happy with this purchase!"
-1,I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
-1,Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
-1,Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.
1,"I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand  but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft  light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring  winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size  i am 36d  31"" waist and 5' 2"" so i ordered a large and it fi"
1,Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!  but as others have stated  the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.
0,It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
-1,I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.
1,I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts)  stay put  and wear very well. these are well worth the price.
0,"Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away ""i love it"" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a ""blah"" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice  doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'("" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
-1,This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
1,I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on  i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8  but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger  so unless you have really broad shoulders  you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place  and the little tie in the front is awesome  because not only is it an interesting detail  it can be loosened or tightened d
1,I love this dress. as a petite woman  it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself  it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus
1,I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite
-1,These were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12  but i had to squeeze to get them to close. they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.
-1,As soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one  but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
-1,Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
-1,I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
1,"Great  rather heavyweight  long cardi. i purchased the blue  which is a lovely shade of gray/blue  not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater  but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5""  136 lbs  34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model."
1,This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.
0,I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate  i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
0,The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
1,Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.
0,I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.
0,Following the advice of other reviews  i ordered a size larger than normal  since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere  including the bust.  the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
0,This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.
0,I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully
-1,Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
0,As other reviewers have noted  the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans  but otherwise is unflattering.  also  the color is described as black  but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult  but if able to  i would have returned it.
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.
1,This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
0,But  saldly  no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good  though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue  though  is the fit. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist i typically wear a m in a knit top  but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my
-1,"Wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes. i am 5'7""  160lbs  34dddd  and the size large was the correct size."
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.
-1,This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
0,I love how this dress is photographed  but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress  but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.
1,I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray  bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.
-1,This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big  loose and had no shape at all.
-1,Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.
0,Wow  this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?
0,"Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold"
1,Ever since i saw this dress i fall for it totally love the pattern and the colors. i got the size l and the fabric is really good. once i tried it on tho it broke my heart the dress fit perfect everywhere but in the v neck... the design there is odd i believe is for small breast cup girls  im size c and let me tell you  it look horrible  i was very disappointed so dress its going back :(
0,Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
1,I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size  medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight  casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.
-1,"I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11""  slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts. the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the"
0,I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.
1,I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.
-1,This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big  but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
