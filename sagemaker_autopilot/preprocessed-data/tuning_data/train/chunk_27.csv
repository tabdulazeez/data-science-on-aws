0,A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
-1,While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
-1,Really like this dress but.....  the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.  impossible!  has to go back
1,This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l
0,For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.
0,They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
1,I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn't as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn't a stretchier denim. but  my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good.
1,This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!
1,It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room.
-1,Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.
-1,I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
0,This dress is such a crazy beautiful color  the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it  and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice  but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest  but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either  so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway  but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
-1,I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope.
1,Love this sweater! great quality & styling. slimming and the side slits add a feminine appeal. pair with your legging and boots and enjoy the compliments.
-1,I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.
-1,I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.
1,Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
0,I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing
0,This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t
-1,Loved the look  fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only  you have to be kidding?
-1,I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big  it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
-1,I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
0,I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!
-1,I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.
1,This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
-1,Material is too thin and quality is poor
-1,"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful"
0,I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me  the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
-1,This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
0,"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1""  140lbs  36d  39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
1,Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.
0,I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest  but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip  but ultimately decided to return it.
1,Since there isn't one where i live  i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s  and yes  it's a tad large on me  but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
0,I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also  runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.
-1,When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
0,This is a gorgeous top; however  it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
0,This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
1,I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me  the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length  it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but  overall  it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ
1,I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!
0,This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
0,This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.
-1,I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
-1,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
1,These pants are perfect for any casual occasion. they can be worn to run errands  hang around the house  or even go out with friends. i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you don't want to wear jeans or anything tight. they are a bit pricy  but i'm very happy with how they fit.
0,This sweater was unflattering me  very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off  however this one went back.
-1,Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
1,"I read the rave reviews  but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6""  135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today."
1,Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect  shouldn't fit tight  should flow  has lots of room  it is linen  adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
0,I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.
0,This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure  but since i've got curves/an athletic build  it simply did not work. too bad  because it is such a pretty dress!
1,This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length  even though i got the regular and not the petite.
1,Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable  versatile  and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
0,I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.
1,I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending. it fits great  is flattering  and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough.    overall it was a great purchase!
0,Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out  and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
0,I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
1,Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky  although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!  but it's a keeper
1,Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!
1,"This pants are very comfortable  and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7  135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!"
1,I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
0,Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
1,"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!"
0,I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite  but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
1,"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect  not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!"
0,"I loved the pattern  color and mock turtleneck style of this top  but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5""  32d  110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work  but every time i raised my arms  you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also  and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s"
-1,This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.
-1,Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me. :-(
1,This looks just as pictured. it's comfortable but dressy. i love it!
