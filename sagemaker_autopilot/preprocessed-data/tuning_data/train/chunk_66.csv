0,I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great  and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs  which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m  but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips  fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically  if you're deliberating between s and m for this top  get
1,Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.
0,I purchased this shirt in a medium  in the wine color. i love the drape and fit of the shirt. it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy. it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts i've bought at retailer. you could easily dress this up or down. i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat. it majorly shrunk! now i can't wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more. if you purc
1,I love this skirt. i usually don't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy. but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing  and yet it has structure. the colors are great and go with many top options. i wear it to work and casual outings. it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now.
1,"I have never looked good in a legging. stretchy denim ""jeggings"" are usually the most i can get away with. but i am amazed how flattering these are! the fit is great (i got a m cause i'm small  but curvy in my hips/butt)  the material is thick enough not to reveal too much  and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed. the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too -- i'm pretty short  but they aren't too long on me  there's a ve"
1,I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute  having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings  seaside strolls  chilly restaurants  or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
0,I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print  but when i finally received  i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model  so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on
-1,This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however  the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't  so it's going back.
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.
-1,I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
-1,The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however  the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.
-1,"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable."
-1,This sweater is so cute and seems high quality. i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste  going down just below my mid section. i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it.
1,Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.
1,Cute layered cami. great colors for summer or fall. very light fabric  tends to get a bit staticy. shorter in the back than expected but a good versatile top
0,Ordered these in two colors( moss and bronze)  same size (26). the moss fit perfectly and the bronze  i can't even button. so very frustrating  particularly when shipping fees are involved. i'm keeping the pair that fit but was hoping to have a couple pairs. perhaps i'll try on another pair in the store. its a nice lean slimming pant that will work from fall through spring. the material is a bit thick for summer. soft and a tad stretchy to allow ease of movement. looking forward to wearing with
1,Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side  it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.
0,"First of all i need to state that i am 5 1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel  it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan  there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c"
0,Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big  the xxs are sold out. typical.
1,I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.
-1,I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
0,I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?
-1,"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store  which makes sense because if it were hung it up  fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made  so thin with cloth  that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes"
0,Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid  but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned 
-1,The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size.
-1,"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.  an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.  the fabric is quite beautifu"
-1,"Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference  i say i am 5' 4"" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4""  138-140 lbs.  36c bra. size-wise  i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room."
0,I got this 25% off before christmas. i immediately started wearing it  thinking it would be a staple. i like the swing shape; the shape feels just right - not too baggy. but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals  collects lint like crazy  and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times. also  there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area (as you can see in retailer's picture). it looks out of place in person. i'm left loving the s
1,"Very much in love with this ethereal  delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy  so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down  otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#"
1,"While the blue color pictured is stunning  i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail  especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next  this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque  but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!"
0,This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
0,I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.
-1,Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great
0,I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined  but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.
1,Love  love  love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice  however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops.
0,I wanted to love this top. the neckline made it look strange on me. if i untied it  it looked sloppy. so  it went back. i love the print though.
-1,Loved this online  but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.
1,Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short  just perfect.
0,This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture  but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.
0,I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother 
1,Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
1,The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back  as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped  so take care when laundering.
0,I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.
-1,The fit of the top is true to size  but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i'm absolutely sending it back.
0,"I am 5'2"" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste."
1,Cute shirt  it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!
0,The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.
1,This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly  i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft  and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
-1,Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
1,This skirt is so cute!! highly recommend  super easy to dress up or to dress down. it isn't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt. i have gotten so many compliments on it  random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it. it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up. also  if you're taller like me it is a little short in the back. overall  a great buy!
-1,"I am 5'4"" 120lbs  got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy  great quality  unfortunate design. not worth the money."
-1,"I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70  but i think if i saw it in person first  i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute  the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels  necklace  armful of bangles  you can probably distract from the fabric.     5'5""  120lb  purchased xs and it's a little big still."
0,I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it  even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well  though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove
-1,I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
1,I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..
0,"Pros: material is amazing  super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this  just enough  it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders  chest and the length is good.    cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8""  150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too  which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.    i'll pro"
1,I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
1,The material feels nice and i love the flared arms.
1,Great fit  perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!
1,I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.
1,Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point  as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
0,This is a very comfortable shirt    great basic to have in the wardrobe    it runs a little high on the sides
1,Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly  cotton  and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.
-1,I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown  rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested  it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.
0,This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor  though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric  while soft and comfortable  is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears  the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.
0,It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.
-1,"I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.  the ""shawl"" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed. i already returned this."
0,Dress is very pretty  but very short  almost tunic length.
-1,Is gigantic-it could be so cute  but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low. i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds  and a small was huge on me.
-1,I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
-1,Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
