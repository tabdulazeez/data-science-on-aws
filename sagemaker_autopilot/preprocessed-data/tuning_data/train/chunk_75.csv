1,This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.
1,This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light  airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.
1,This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.
-1,I ordered the black and white pattern  which was ok. i got a small  but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.
-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.
1,"Ordered this dress online and hoped for the best  because there wasn't a size chart to reference. i'm usually in between a size small and a medium  i ordered the size small and it fit well. for a more flowy look i would have gone with the medium.  everything about this dress is soft  i love it! even the ribbon is delicate  soft and made of quality material. the lining feels like heaven.     this dress goes to the floor on me - i'm 5' 7"" - i was expecting it to be more mid ankle length  but i sti"
0,I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
0,I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
1,This blouse is pretty sheer  but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure  and a very cute opening in on the lower back.
-1,There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced.
0,Love the top design  not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.
1,Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.
-1,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.
-1,"Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la"
0,I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.
1,This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape  and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress  but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece  this one is a winner!
1,I was so excited to order this dress; however  once it arrived  i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside  and the dress clung to my trouble areas.
0,"I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot  it had a flattering fit on me  extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1"" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct"
1,This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding  even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!  note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit  enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out  doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr
0,Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.
0,I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans  unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure  i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
1,Needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops.  hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint.  they fit like a glove and are true to size.  i don't think the picture does them justice.  if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants.  you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer.  i would not hesitate to purchase them.
0,"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look  short  sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets)  and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed  but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all  which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back"
1,This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.
1,I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.
0,This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.
1,For cat lovers in particular  these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this  i would say size down two sizes."
1,Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket.  the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall.  runs tts.
-1,I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
0,Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
0,I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.
-1,It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
0,"I am 5'6"" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft  and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top."
0,This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.
-1,Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
-1,"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great"
1,I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually  i like all the new styles at retailer right now)  and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the
1,This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist  - or if you have broad shoulders  the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p  with a 00p hip measurement  a middle range (00p is 24  0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement  but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p  the larger
-1,"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned."
0,I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.
1,The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress.   the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch  i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.    this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines
1,I have these pants in a larger size  but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.  they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.  keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.  just wish they would be available in tall!!!
-1,"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back."
-1,I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
-1,I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week  but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also  the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.
-1,Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!
1,What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips  but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
-1,The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
0,This is a very light  flowy dress. the lining is very fitted  but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow  but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
0,The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however  the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright  but would be a nice transition to fall top.  the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
-1,I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted  but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through.     fit is tts.
1,I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.
0,I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person  if it is still available when the price comes down  i might buy it.
1,This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a 2 or 4 in retailer  and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.
0,I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.
0,Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
-1,It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.
1,I ordered this top in the grey along with the white lace up back pocket tee. while the other tee was totally see through and very poor quality  this one delivers in every way. in fact  i am sending the other one back to get this top in the ivory as well. the lace is very substantial and the fabric is not see through at all  like so many tops are these days. i ordered my usual medium and it comes down over my bum  just like i wanted to wear with leggings. i see this as a staple and this is my fir
-1,Awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed
-1,I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two  if not three  sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body  other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough  especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w
0,I thought these would be nice  and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also  the jewels make the jeans feel heavier.   fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans  slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer  as not only am i short  but i have short legs for my shortness!)    so if you want that styl
0,I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears
-1,I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
0,"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes  but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful  fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6""  155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide  so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small  but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang"
0,Very cute shirt  well made  nice detail  but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
1,These were as great in person as i had hoped; great color for fall  super comfy and flattering fit. happy with my purchase!
-1,I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.
-1,This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life  not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
0,This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.
1,This is beautiful. it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i can't wait to start wearing it.
