1,Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small   and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.
0,They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
0,So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.
1,"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress  beautifully made  looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit"
-1,Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.
-1,And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice  color pretty  not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....
1,"I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs. i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37  30d/32c bra  with narrow shoulders and torso  a bit long-waisted. the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight. low cut  but not as low as on the model; very flattering neckline. sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded up.  .  well made  very lightweight knit of 57% cotton  43% polyester. the ribbing detail is very well thought out. there is bias"
0,Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
0,I was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season. i wasn't sure what i thought when trying it on  but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it. for me the waistline was a bit high  and it had a bit of a frumpy feel. i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasn't amazing.
-1,"This dress looks lovely on the model  but it looks just awful on me! i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve  it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space. the material is nice and the sequins are pretty  but the cut of the dress is unflattering."
0,This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material  it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me  but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.
-1,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
0,This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful  but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs  and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.
-1,The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.
0,"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately  there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress."
1,Yes  this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on  oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d
-1,It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however  the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store  unfortunately.
1,I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small  but returned and exchanged for a medium  which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
-1,I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape  i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff  and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
1,Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman  i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now  that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.
1,This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy  comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.
0,It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .
0,"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater  and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side  with 34g chest  155lbs 5' 5""  and the med was too big  (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type."
-1,I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not
1,Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo. tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i'm a 34 dd  5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine. i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher  but none were available. still the regular 10 works well. excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans  and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami. seems very ve
0,I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great  but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.
0,"I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me  this dress fit terribly. however  the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3"" and about 117 with a really short torso  and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller  or maybe with a longer torso  i could see this dress being really lovely."
-1,I'll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap  cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean  this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
0,I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now  so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful  but there is no lining  leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d
1,"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend. i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
-1,I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs
0,After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
1,This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!
1,"I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. i am 5'6"" and 107lbs.  32d. the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs."
1,This general sweatshirt is cute  stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.
1,These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly  as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.
-1,Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
-1,Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.
1,I have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small. i'm 5'8  an athletic pear with narrow shoulders  34c  and usually a 6 in tops at retailer. since the top looks a little short on the model  i sized up to an 8  since i'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer. i'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip  and if it were any smaller  it'd be too tight in my chest. since it doesn't stretch  you need some space for your arms to move. if i could do it again  i'd actually si
1,I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual  2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown  so it is not constricting at all.
1,I am a shopper....i shop a lot. this is one of my favorite dresses of all time! so unique  and  as others have said  like a piece of art! the fit is tight through the middle but that's what makes it look so perfect. i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike. i love it!
-1,This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
-1,"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4""  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online."
1,This is a beautiful skirt. great  soft  draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large  which was an okay fit  perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy  this made me look wider than i am. as an elder  i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly  returned but i do recommend.
0,Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty  but the shape isn't flattering  at least not to me. might work better on a teen?
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor
-1,The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.
0,I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
-1,I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite  it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
1,I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute  casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small."
-1,I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this
0,Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.
0,This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery  yet subtle  and it's a nice sturdy cotton  not flimsy and cheap looking. however  i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts  but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin  this might be great for you.
1,This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.
-1,Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
1,"I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!"
-1,What a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2  105lbs  and ordered the xxs petite.
-1,I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper  the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper  so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper  i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???
1,Even though this shirt is incredibly thin  i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup  with white jeans in the summer  over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!
1,This dress is absolutely stunning and well made. it can be worn throughout the seasons. i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece.
0,Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
-1,Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.  i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same.   obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed  they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.
1,Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3  117 lbs  34 b cup  and took an xs. top fits comfortably  no tightness around the chest  and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through  so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet  so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!
1,These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
-1,It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality  like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall  not the dress or quality i expected :/
0,The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.
-1,I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however  i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves  but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer  and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i
0,Love the colors and design  however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows  and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it.
0,Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
0,I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
