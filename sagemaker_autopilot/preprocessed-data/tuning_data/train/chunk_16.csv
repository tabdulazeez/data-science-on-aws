0,I loved the fit  color and style  but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.
0,This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso  but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion  though  so not sure if its just me and my complex. if you don't have a short torso then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.  overall  i am not sure who this was designed for.. but
0,This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.
1,This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches  it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style  not trendy so it wi
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b"
1,"Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs."
0,"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim  and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition  the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues."
1,Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.
0,I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.
-1,I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
1,I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder  loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.
1,This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors  drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.
1,This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy  however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.
-1,One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide.
1,I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman  i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me.
-1,This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go. :-(
1,I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type  which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame  but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.
-1,Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock
0,"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand."
1,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.
0,Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
1,The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.
-1,I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.
-1,White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.
0,Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper  trouser-like pant--this is not it!
1,The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.  i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit  so if you prefer something more form fitting  you might opt for a smaller size.
1,"Color  fabric blend  and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately  i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso  or like the short look  i would recommend this!"
0,"I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice  too. however  i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6"" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much."
1,Love this sweater but it's too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it.
-1,I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy  the sleeves too long  and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very  very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers  but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed  especially given the price  but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac
0,I really like the look of this dress  but i ended up returning it because it was too short. the shoulder area was also too big on me.
-1,This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
-1,I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit  and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.
1,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.
1,I bought three -- in part  because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said  they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now.     i am typically a small  and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes  but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.     all-i
0,I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.
-1,I am a 32dd  5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
0,I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.
0,If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
-1,It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.
1,I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier  i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
0,I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap
1,I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer  the length was not awkward and kept it from being to
-1,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.
0,This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return
0,"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes."
-1,I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the
0,"I really wanted to love this dress....     i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly  the top was just too ""balloon like"" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it."
-1,I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.
1,Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store  it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand  and me being a more plus sized gal  their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops ..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color
0,I ordered this top online in two colors  and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day  the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering  and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
0,The material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well.  when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out. it made me look much bigger than i am.  i ordered a large (normally i wear lg or xl) and it's possible a medium would have fit better. unfortunately this shirt had to be returned.
1,The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.
0,"I wrote item ran large  but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10"" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice  but it does have some issues."
-1,Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life  this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin  extremely casual  not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.
-1,This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!
0,It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
-1,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.
0,Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
1,I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10  the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.
-1,I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
1,Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
-1,This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.
0,Cute top  not great on me. beautiful  bright color.
1,This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well  not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi
1,Amazingly soft  thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!
