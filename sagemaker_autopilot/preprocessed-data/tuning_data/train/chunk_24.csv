0,In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
-1,I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size  this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
-1,"I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue."
1,"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway  i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs  5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft  nad looks like it may not wrinkles  which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute  but you can't really wear this untied  so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"
0,I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .
1,This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable  yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique  yet whimsical swimsuit style.
0,I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment  like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips  typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before  and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li
0,I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax  shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
-1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
-1,I was really excited to get this dress  i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on  it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit  and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there  and the look of the dress on line was beautiful  but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look  and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
-1,"The material is horrible  it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning."
-1,"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur"
1,I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace  for the weekend. i am 137 lbs  a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.
1,This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room  so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so  so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.
-1,Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference  i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs  it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant!
0,Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan  but not this time. the print is okay  but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt  but since it was neither it was returned?
0,This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
1,I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy  but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape)  and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary  but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size  which helped  and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant  and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath  just bare skin   but they're so small that i don
1,I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it's a relaxed fit so it's not super fitted and it's loose around the waist which is great. it's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!
-1,I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
-1,The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
1,"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully  i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference  i am 5'6""  145 lbs  34dd. also  the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said."
1,"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.    i ordered the small  and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy  with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on.     i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4""  the petite is the way to go. however  i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a"
-1,The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
1,This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  2 buttons popped off!
-1,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.
0,Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
1,Okay  so in terms of quality  i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store  but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs  5'7  115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t
0,The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
-1,Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
1,I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color  and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
0,Although the fabric and color is beautiful   the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.
0,I got the pink version. it is a pretty color  but the metallic border is painted  not a metallic yarn. the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy. it looks cheap to me--not what i expect from retailer. am returning.
-1,"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
-1,Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
-1,Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
1,I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out  or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird""."
1,This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.
0,"Just received pants and even though they are labeled ""petite"" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26  which is not what the description states."
1,"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up  but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable  warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size  i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!"
1,First time trying pilcro  but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!
0,Colors washed me out  i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model
-1,"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill-fitting sack."
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
1,"For the last two years  i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand  but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all  the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned  the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will"
0,I was in love with the green print  so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.
1,When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
1,I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!
1,Love the way these pants look in the pictures  great quality  but the style isn't really me. i gave it a try  so that's what counts!
-1,Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.
1,A fun  casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing)  which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said  the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this  but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy  but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.
1,This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft  comfortably loose  but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!
-1,I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately  the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots  which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time  and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.  in terms of sizing  this fits tts  i normally wear a l or xl  got this in an
0,Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
-1,I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all  it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
-1,"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope"
0,"I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great.   the first time i pulled it out at home  i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side  the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for"
0,"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease  modern look  and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years)  but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt  and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.
1,This top is absolutely adorable  fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
0,I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!
0,This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely  but between the fit and the scratchy fabric  this is headed back. too bad!
1,I recently bought this blouse  the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!
0,I bought 3 of these tops in different colors  the blue one had one sleeve noticeably shorter. sent it back. now less than 10 days later they are on sale. the style is darling and get many complements on the two i have. fyi i'm a 36d 130lbs and med fit great
1,Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos  there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that  it's a beautiful  unique summer top.
0,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
