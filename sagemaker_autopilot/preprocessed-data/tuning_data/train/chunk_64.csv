0,I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n
-1,I found this dress to be very short waisted  much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
0,While i love the design  this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
0,I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
1,"5 7""   138 pound   73 year old grandmother. can't wear wool and always looking for stylish cotton/linen sweaters.  ordered m based on reviews. very tight across back and sleeves too short. loved the style  the below hip length  and color so reordered in a large. still waiting for sweater. hoping it fits better"
1,This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head  the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra! i would order from this brand again.
1,I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!
1,I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
-1,I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!
-1,I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
-1,I like the color blocking of this top  but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.
0,This runs small  i got the size 3 which fits like a medium  not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit  it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
-1,Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back
-1,This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color  it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white  needless to say it went back.
1,So  i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting  but they were so cute  i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist  which is a plus  because sometimes  even if the legs fit  the waist is too small  or vice versa. i am a large  and very curvy on the bottom  and these are perfect and flattering  and the elastic waist is just right. as on the
1,This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless  ageless piece. i bought the medium  which fits perfectly (size 8 top  34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that  in the photo  the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem  but this was annoying. i wore
0,"A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure  this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.  i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta  but definitely needed a large.  i ordered the ""lavender"" color  which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead."
1,I love this dress. i am an hourglass and found this dress to be super flattering and such a unique find. i usually avoid pockets in front like this  but it works on this dress. so happy i found it.
0,The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
1,"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top  but longer in the skirt! yes  please! i purchased the turquoise  which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference  i'm 5'6""  136 lbs and ordered a size small."
1,This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it's not as see-through as other tees i've seen.
-1,"I don't know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the ""knit"" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms!"
-1,I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.
-1,I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
0,I really  really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty  and the front was flattering  but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly  i sent it back.
-1,This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears  several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews  i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
-1,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
-1,This item is huge. i'm normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent.
0,The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
1,"This is a really nice top  especially for the price. i am 5'6""  34dd  140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the ""boxy"" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer  though. white tops should be"
1,This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange  which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice  hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details  the scallops  and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips  so get in the w
0,"Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5"" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special."
0,"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk  but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high  almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it  the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"
-1,I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12  hourglass)  these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds  just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
0,Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.
1,Love the petroleum blue unique twist design love the sleeve length perfect for work -- neckline not too low great by itself or with a bib necklace and black jacket absolute winner
0,I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered  this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again  this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
-1,I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.
1,Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :)
0,I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves  so current. unfortunately  it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small  and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair  so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!    i am keeping it because i love the style  but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.  i got the x-small and am a 3
0,I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.
1,Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.
0,According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10  but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage  the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12  but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit  the ddd would have fit fine  i think.
0,I was so excited for this romper  but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price  and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
-1,Unfortunately  this sweater let me down! i love retailer  especially their sweaters  but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms  and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work  alas  i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
1,Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!
1,I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used  especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms  so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a
0,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace  while pretty  to be quite rough  which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference  5'5""  125 lbs  34d. sad  but this went back."
1,This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down. the slits are high  so you are exposed like a short shirt.
-1,Hi  i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.
1,"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly  yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!"
-1,This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(
-1,I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
0,I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous  but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
-1,This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
1,Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
0,This dress is gorgeous  but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.
0,So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small  didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine  has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
1,I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue  it's fun  it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite)  but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great  and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.
1,I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small  but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
1,This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
0,I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great  if the fit works for you.
1,I love this top. it was cool on a summers day. i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine  not ruined at all.
-1,"The print  colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small  as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all."
0,Thought this looked so cute  especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large  the fabric felt super cheap  and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned.
0,Online this top looks fabulous  but in person  not so great. great color  nice quality for a lightweight top  but when i tried it on  the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found  for me  it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest  so didn't work. for reference  i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
-1,If i could sew  i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well)  but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
0,This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
-1,This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.
-1,I loved this dress before putting it on  but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
