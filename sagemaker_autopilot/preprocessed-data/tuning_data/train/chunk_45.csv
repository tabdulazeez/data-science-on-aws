-1,I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
0,This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut  and that the buttons are covered. however  the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly  i don't think i can recommend this shirt  though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body  but it still looks great. i hope this helps!
0,This vest is very nice and fashionable  very stylish. i like it a lot. however  it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however  the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere  so i could not imaging wearing this vest  it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
0,It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.
-1,I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.
1,The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter  but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
-1,I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
-1,"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or i better say  it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately  it stretched more than a full size  and generally lost its shape. now  the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore."
1,"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!"
1,This dress is really beautiful. the material is soft and sways  but it is sweater-like  not flimsy. it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout  but i liked that look. not form-fitting  has more of a drape.
0,I really wanted to keep this dress  and the material is amazing  so soft and gentle and delicate  the design is great  the front looks nice  but from back looks really awkward  big and kind of too loose!
1,Love the fabric  print  and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline  but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
-1,Like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose  billowy  and perhaps
1,"Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater  buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white  which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt  for the ""sweater dress"" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket."
1,"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders  and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print  and it spelled disaster.    size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5"" tall  135 lbs  34d  35-29-37  narrow across shoulders  with short arms and long torso.    fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however  the sleeves didn't sl"
0,I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though  so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants  but wanted to let you kno
-1,The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it's going back.
0,"This top is gorgeous in person  but when i tried it on  i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately  but the more i wore it around the fitting room area  the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8""  140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes  it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me."
0,I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish
0,"I'm 5'4""  usually a small in retailer sizes  6-8 pants  i purchased the 8 petite"
0,I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.
-1,This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.
0,Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
-1,"I'm 5'4"" 120#   34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model."
-1,"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar  sleeves  material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer.    i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4""  140lbs and busty...a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material."
0,This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off  and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
1,This coat looks great  but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws  it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
-1,I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
1,If the dress fits  there is nothing not to love about it. the color  of mine  is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online (deeper and richer than the studio photos). it is not too sheer  as another reviewer reported. it has a slip  and the fabric is beautiful.    the issue i've had has been sizing and style. i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs. the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos. i was looking for the very floaty  full dres
0,The colors on this sweater are cute  the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.
1,"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell  nor does it itch  as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color  but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1""  but ordered the regular xs  and i am happy with the length."
1,I love this sweater. comfortable and flattering. great for going out causal and staying warm!
1,Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes  but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on  it was big under the arms and waist area  i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect.
1,I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.
-1,"Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5"")  it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter  the sleeves are huge  the neckline was falling off my shoulder  i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes."
1,First saw this jacket in the catalog  in peach  and had to have it. i received it today  and love it. its a soft  muted peach  very neutral. i ordered xl  im usually a m-l  but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great  feels good on. love it so much  i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket  will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces  never disappoints.
1,"I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative  and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes  yet i do not like to look ""frumpy."" this is cute and chic  yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!"
1,This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich  luxurious fabric  a deep neckline  and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and  while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers  for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!
1,I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
-1,Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2  130 lbs  34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately  i will be returning.
-1,"I ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine  side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back  even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong."
1,Comfortable and loose fitting- perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on. can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch. good color  too!
0,I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures  a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.
-1,I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
-1,Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.
0,I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on  but didn't fit me.
-1,Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots  and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!
0,I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don't need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they're a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn't look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven't decided yet if i'm keeping or returning.
0,Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather  i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous  but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
-1,This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned
0,After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.
1,This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made  either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal  salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
-1,This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
1,True to size  and adorable. very lightweight  will be great for the long  hot summer ahead!
-1,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned."
-1,This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
1,"I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small  i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b  there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5"" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees."
1,I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.
0,I'm not in love with this  but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s  and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b  26 inch waist  120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso  and i realize the design is for it to be flowy  as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model  which is
-1,I am normally between a size 0 and 2  so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around  so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out  was bagging in the crotch area  sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
1,I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store  but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts)  and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low
1,This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.  very figure flattering
-1,The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.
0,Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.
-1,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!
0,This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line  but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out  but based on the length on me  it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference  i am 5'8 with a long torso.
0,After the reviews about sizing  i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly  the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said  the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big  it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide  crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the
0,"I am 5'4""  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event."
