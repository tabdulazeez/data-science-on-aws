0,I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
-1,I feel that for this price  i should love this top (and i wanted to). however  the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top  and there were a few things about it that could be improved.  pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally  the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and  generally speaking  has a nice pattern. overall  it's a very pretty top.  cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
0,Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.
1,I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.
-1,The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
-1,"The cut is small. i am 5'9""  150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand."
1,This is adorable and unique. i've tried shawls and ponchos before  they usually swallow me up  this sweater has that type of feel but isn't so much fabric. goes with everything.
1,I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
-1,On the hanger i thought this had a chance  but oh geez... puffy sleeves  itchy  metallic thread  lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no  no  no.
0,Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.
0,I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0  98 lbs  32a  and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly  which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest  so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves
1,I loved this dress immediately.  i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt.  only one complaint.  it's a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).
0,In the photo  this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7  always take a size medium but on me  the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button  it stretches and looks terrible. in the back  it falls short. it's going back.
-1,"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)"
1,This dress is beautiful  i usually wear a 6 or 8 and i ordered a 4  it is huge  i will be returning.
0,I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however  if you are chesty  this piece shows off more than i was comfy with  and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body  i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top  the xs showed much too much cleavage.  (34d  5'  115).  i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
1,I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
1,This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!
-1,I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.
0,This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
1,This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon  soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though
-1,On me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu. it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming. i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier  no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try  just not for me...    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
0,I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full
0,The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.
-1,I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.
1,This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top  but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill.
0,I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea  but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model  so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me  because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful  the pink is more a blush and washed me out  the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t
0,I usually wear small  ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great  just meh  returning it.
-1,I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe  but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
0,I knew i would love this dress  it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves  these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but  the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4  or s/m this was a small. will return. if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.
0,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
1,"Loved this dress. fit like a glove  so flattering  and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4  large chest  and curvy  and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me  but i actually love it being tea-length.     a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it ""poof."" i removed it  but looks good either way."
-1,I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie  this item was too small  especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful  but unfortunately  i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.
0,This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling  color  fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.  the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need."
0,"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely  but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly  too  the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it  which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you  great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter"
-1,Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
1,"I have always had a thing for velvet  and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured  but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up  but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide"
-1,"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!"
0,Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
-1,This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.
-1,The fabric is very nice on this wrap  but it wears like a blanket.
0,"Love the way this dress looks online. sadly  it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4""  athletic build. the small fit perfectly  but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me  but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off."
-1,I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.
0,It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(
1,Super comfortable top. easily washable  2 options with the sleeves  and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top.
-1,I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray  not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.
0,I purchased this  and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green  and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall  unimpressed.
-1,I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice  but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
1,No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.
0,"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab  yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons  yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands  yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits  so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
0,"The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews  but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4""."
-1,I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.
1,"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable  but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture."
1,I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!
-1,"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14  i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size."
-1,I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
1,Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side  but for me  it was big    too bad the smaller size is sold out (well  all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long  below the knee  but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists  adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!
0,Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is  however  not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd  the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted  it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked  as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!
1,Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium  and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo  which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.
1,Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering  with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person  the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute  i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.
1,"This is a very comfortable  good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short  and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on  it's great.  it is not made in the usa  as stated. it is clearly marked ""made in mexico"" from ""globally sourced"" materials (i.e. not from the us)."
0,"I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd  5'3""  curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!"
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
-1,Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.
0,Relaxed fit  soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price  i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
1,Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable  loose flowing  and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that  i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large  but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!
1,I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy  however  i like this type of the style.
1,"Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b  27"" waist  and 36"" hip and 5'3"" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price."
1,I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online  and decided to order it. the fabric is soft  but strong  and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.
