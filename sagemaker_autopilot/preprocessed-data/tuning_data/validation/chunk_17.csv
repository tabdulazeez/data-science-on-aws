-1,Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different 
1,I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return)  i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.
1,The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.
0,I love these jeans  but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.
1,Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me  fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it.
-1,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!"
-1,"This tunic only barely resembles the photo in person.  first  the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos  second  it's huge. i'm 5'4"" and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies' shirts/dresses. i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be. it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless; and the style doesn't really lend itself to use with a belt."
0,Ahhh  i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed  this top runs very large. style wise  it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.
0,Love the fabric and it seemed warmed. but as other reviewers mentioned  the neckline was awkward.
1,Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?
0,Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
1,"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!"
1,I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple  yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.
1,This is a simple shirt  but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton  and though i adore retailer  i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy  because i prefer the feel of silk  linen and cotton. thanks for this one  retailer!
0,My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great  but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath  but don't even think about wearing it by itself!
-1,The beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.
0,"It's ok  fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide  hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an"
0,"I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back."
-1,This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
-1,I've been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale. the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it! this will be going back to the store!!!!
0,If you have muscular thighs  like me  these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed  i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
-1,I was really looking forward to these tees working  after reading the reviews. unfortunately  they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.
-1,I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.
1,I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally  i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact  the fabric is beautiful  soft  and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights  tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on  as it is highly u
0,I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter  which others do mention  but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape  i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material  is very nice and it's well made  but it's going back.
0,"I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5""  128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though  but i was really hoping to find a nice  versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f"
-1,I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.
0,Maybe it's just me  but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7  around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give  but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe. the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model  and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
-1,I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.
-1,I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.
-1,Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
0,I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.
0,This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful  overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.
0,The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size
1,Very true to size. i'm a sm-med or 6-8. my sizing varies widely at retailer and this was a perfect medium fit.  adorable with jeans or shorts. or dress up with suit or pencil skirt.  i have the blue/green.
-1,"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled  but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny  and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny  not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again  maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle"
-1,I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful  plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
-1,I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
-1,"Regretfully  this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size  i ordered it in both colors  however  the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress  and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again  the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching  pulls   or tears for an exchange  but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn."
1,"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish  so cozy  the perfect length to cover your bottom  the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl)  love the pockets  i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear."
0,Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.
0,"While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7""  128lb and ordered the small."
1,My preference is clothing made of natural fibers  but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric  the color   the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6  i bought a 4. maeve  i like your style!
1,"My favorite pair of ags. i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ""ankle"" length on me. i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe. it doesn't seem like they've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want. i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down."
-1,I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m
1,Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.
1,This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!
0,Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.
0,I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv
1,I love the style and the flow of this shirt. definitely worth the purchase and very flattering!
1,I bought a size xl in the white with brighter small florals. i paid full-price as a splurge for summer. the details on the top are just as nice in person as shown in the photos. it's a sweet top. i love the upper portion. however  it runs long. i need to belt it/tuck it or it looks strangely like a long-tunic. the floral material is slippery and a little heavy. not the softest but it's washed well. i love the mix of laces at the top. it's pretty. not worth full-price but on sale  it's worth tryi
1,"These are really cute pants. nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall. the only problem for me was the sizing. i tried my usual xs/0  (5'7""  115lbs) but they were huge - as in  pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short. the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have"
1,Tis is a soft  soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute. it's a great top to use put on and go. i'm looking forward to wearing it often!
1,Very comfortable and cute. i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store  i was disappointed. however  after trying it on  i had to have it. very flattering and comfortable.
1,I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me  but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built
0,I love the colors in this top  but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.
1,When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric. it's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear  and it is fully lined. it's more substantial in a good way. also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it's definitely a swing which i prefer. with the lining  it does stand out a bit from your body so it's not a clingy look at all. i like it a lot but i don't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo. it's roomy  i could probably have sized down. i
1,This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day  and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.
1,"I found this to be true to size (m fit me well - 5'7""  140 lb  usually a size m for tops). it does have a straight fit  and it hits at the waist. i wouldn't call it cropped  but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer. it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath  and you can pull the shirt's cuffs over the sweatshirt. the sleeves were a great length."
-1,I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen  but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.    at first glance  i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy  single layer of unlined  unstructured fabric  to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt  i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
-1,I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
0,I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress  new name and color. generally  this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.  recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.  the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing.
-1,I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas  it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
0,I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m  and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column  i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it  but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing  and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
1,"Great quality coat! very pretty colors and love the sleeves! i would have given 5 stars  but like other reviewers stated  this coat does she'd. best not to wear black. it is a slight ""swing"" style coat  so it's not fitted at the waist and hips  but very stylish. i found it best to size down. i'm 5'4 118lb  but i'm large chested (32dd) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest  but the six was too big. the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater!"
0,I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock  and when it did  i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges  depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution  so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package  but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom  and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing  but
0,Love these pants. ordered in petite . love style  great fit but so long .   keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.   decided to order the black & green as well.
-1,Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
-1,Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.
0,I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.
