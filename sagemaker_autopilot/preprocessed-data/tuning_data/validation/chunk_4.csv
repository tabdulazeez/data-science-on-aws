-1,What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem  it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.
0,I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top  once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif. i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large. it's a shame  the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty  go up a size or two. if you are usually a
1,I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality  with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra  which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o
0,One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.
1,The color and quality of these jeans is great. they were too large in my normal size. more of a boyfriend fit so size down.
-1,On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
-1,This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.
-1,This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
0,Nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available.
1,"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger  i may have bought it just for lounging  but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me  but cute for teens and early 20's."
0,I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl   wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full   a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
1,I may regret returning this sweater  because it would be lovely had i been able to wear it as i was when i ordered it. as i am in a wheelchair temporarily  i find the sweater too bulky in a sitting position. if you are slender and are looking for vertical lines that are slimming in a style so fashionable now  this is the sweater for you! the neutral colors and the bulky weave i also love because it goes with everything--a go-to sweater-coat.
1,"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s"
-1,Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
1,This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.
0,"I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color  the fabric  and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.  now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a"
-1,Material is hard to wear a bra under it
0,I love the idea of ruffles  but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium  and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes  it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer  but it's pretty thick.
0,I wanted to love it  but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous  but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.
-1,Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
0,Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.
0,"I love these shorts  very pretty and well made  but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs  beware  not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg  creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on ""skinny"" legs."
-1,"No  no  no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7""  about 145  32c  usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the"
-1,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return."
0,Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
0,I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been
0,If the sweater looked as it does in the picture  i would keep it. however  it was very boxy and short  a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.
-1,Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
0,The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri
-1,This blouse was so cute  i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned  there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person  but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.
-1,The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
-1,This bunches up too much  and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it  it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top  i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.
1,Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
0,I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this  and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically  when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.
1,"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
1,Love this shirt. the print is a little loud  but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however  that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty  if that helps. the red is short-sleeved  by the way if ordered online  cute and flattering.
-1,This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
-1,"I am 5'6""  130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."
-1,"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated  it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately."
-1,"Crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around. the waist section  where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didn't lay well. i am 5'4""  120 lbs  32c  26"" waist  and 32"" hip usually wear a 0 or extra small in the maeve clothing that isn't a fitted style. i bought the s  which fit well except for the waist issue described above. this is a fitted dress. i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received. it is a great style idea."
1,I bought this dress in store today in a size 4  i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress  there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
0,I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top  and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on  and once on  it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.
0,"I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve  you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck  so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
1,These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.  i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall  but these worked with the regular inseam.
0,This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
-1,"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green"
1,I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers  a light blue tank  off white shirt  tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.
1,"I love this dress  it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person  5'4"" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me  but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess."
0,This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
0,I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
1,I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me  but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front  back  or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap  and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d
1,I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago. i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful! so is the design and construction. the fabric is very light and delicate. all the details on the dress are just top notch. the body of the dress is lined  but the sleeves are not - so there's a slight see-through effect on the sleeves  showing the lovely and delicate knit. it fits like a dream  and i've
1,With my 5'9'  hourglass frame  wider hips and having a baby  i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however  with this  i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts: _________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfort. - pockets! always a plus in my book :) - will go with any top. - nice length. fit me as in the model. - very slimming. - you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi
1,Nice stretchy shirt. nothing special so i wouldn't pay more than sale price.
1,I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.
1,"Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material  wool  is substantial and of good quality. however  on my 5'1""  120lb athletic frame  i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me  but all gone."
0,This tee is cute  keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it's huge. i ordered an xxs and it's very loose and drapey  which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also  a totally sheer  basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way.
1,"This is a cute sweater  i agree that it's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute. the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen  more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone. i think it's true to size  i got my usual retailer size: xspetite (i'm 34aa  26"" waist) and it fits just right. it's soft and a nice medium weight. on the packaging it was called a bomber  so i'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket."
1,I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame  but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!
1,I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos  and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting  but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy  but the knit gives it more texture & interest. this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered  but form-fitting and flattering.
-1,This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style  and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w
-1,I bought this t-shirt in pink  blue  red  grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey  has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.
0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.
-1,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
-1,I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!
1,"I love everything about this blouse except for one thing: the peplum just hits way too high up on the body  and i am only 5'4"". 106 and ordered a regular size 2 (not petite) which fits perfectly except for this. it is made of a beautiful textured fabric and is very nice quality. i adore peplums and own many and like the peplum to begin near the waist. however  others may not mind the higher waist and in that case it may work for them. i really hated to send it back it was so pretty but it just w"
0,Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th
0,This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front  that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue  but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.
-1,This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size  but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch  try on and return in store...this went back.
-1,This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.
0,This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
