-1,I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut  but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole
-1,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
-1,The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
-1,This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris  and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash  lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr
1,This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.
0,Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.  on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
0,Not sure what to think! i had great plans for this dress
-1,I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
0,I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however  while i liked the irregular hemline on the model  on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern  definitely no dryer on this one.
0,"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace  substantial fabric  great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders  and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model  they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned  the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4""  120 lbs  and tried a size s."
-1,This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large  arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
-1,Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.
0,This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
0,When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough  but it has a weird under wire  it makes my chest look strange  like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
0,I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan
1,Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress  i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens  i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that  this dress is my fav
1,I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful  i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like
-1,I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you  as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all  and while there is a bow in the back  the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review  but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top  not something special like the picture is o
0,I loved the material's texture and drape  but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees  but...)     other than the see-through nature  i loved this shirt!
0,I liked this top (in black)  but it didn't fit me well. had to return.
1,Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt. i highly recommend it!
-1,I tried this shirt in the purple motif  it fit true to size  my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
1,Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans
0,I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr
0,I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.
0,This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
1,Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.
-1,If you're pregnant  congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs  this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d  normally a small or medium  but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me  although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides  it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve  which makes it look wide at the to
0,"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric."
1,I wanted to comment about the wash. yes  these jeans look really ?dirty? when you  pull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing  the dirty color has really  mellowed. also  i am a usual 26 in jeans  purchased these in 25 and could have fit into   the 24. i may purchase another pair  these jeans are really unique  comfortable  great   for the summer with sandals or converse.
1,This was on display when walked into my local retailer  it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on  instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale  but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!
1,"I love the contemporary style of this piece  but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms  it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces."
1,If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans  leggings  sandals  boots  and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!
-1,I bought this shirt in a l  since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone  unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy  but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
-1,"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them  i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase."
1,Comfy  cozy  and great bargain for the sale price.
1,I am super happy with the t-shirt....it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail!! i'm thinking about buying another!!
1,This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh
0,This shirt runs extremely large. looks boxy and unflattering.
1,I really liked the beautiful fabric  design  and length of the piece.
1,Love this top.!!! this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans. please make it in more colors. i think it should be less expensive.
1,Luv this top/dress/coverup..runs a lil big...i sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans! fabric is nice  comfortable and light!
1,I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again  i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).  colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh
-1,This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull  no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap  shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on  because it was so hideous  when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
-1,I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.
0,"I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5'3""  120 lbs. 34b  and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut  not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn't order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade  with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea"
1,This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
0,I really like the style of this top  and it's delicate but well made  but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer  but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length  and ordered the xxs petite. also  you would have to cut the tag off if you d
1,This is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while  it covers all the important parts without being too baggy. i found the fabric to be light and comfortable  but heavy enough that a light colored bra can't be seen underneath with it great if you don't feel like wearing multiple layers.
0,This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures  but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy  but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so  perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally  and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note  the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the
-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!
0,I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.
0,I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
1,It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect
-1,I agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading! you can't possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured! it does however provide a great fit  i sized down from large to medium...and the brown color is really pretty!
-1,A $200 piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model. avoid ! mine went back the same day it came in the mail...
-1,Looks great on the model  but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size  they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in  but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns  and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a
0,The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.
1,Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.
0,The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.
0,I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed  it's just a really thin material.
1,I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean  any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but  overall this is an adorable dress  very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased  but that's all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!
-1,Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s
-1,I love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes...
1,They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.
-1,For me  this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
-1,"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4  weigh around 120 lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning."
-1,I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
-1,This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
0,I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.
1,I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it! can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous! i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!
0,While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.
