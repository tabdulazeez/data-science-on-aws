1,This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!
0,Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.
1,These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did  so i'm stoked.
1,I love love love the fit in the corduroy  so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well  just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans  and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!
-1,I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
-1,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9""  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the"
-1,I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes
1,I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer  but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet
1,I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.  the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size.
0,This is a very cute shirt with great details. however  it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.
0,"I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line ""princess"" seams in the front and back  but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it."
1,These pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy. the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants. there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well  which i like.
-1,Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back
1,I just received the top today  and will send back for a larger size. i am i between a 4 and 6  so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy. it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders. i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger. the shirt also had a slight musty odor. it's a rather thin chambray....with 3/4 sleeves. the top came to just the top of my jeans  which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering.
-1,I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!
0,"I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles  this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge  ordered an xxsp  the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said  ""that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan"
0,"Cute in concept  so large in reality. i am 5'3""  size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. don't even try if you are a little person. long and lean  yes  would probably look great on you."
-1,Do not waste your money on this.  at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock.   fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.  still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
0,My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.
-1,This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!
0,I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.
-1,Every single time i was in a store  this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however  so when a free shipping offer came up  i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better  but a little snug  so if it shrunk  i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one  it would have been the large; however  they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger  but on a body  it is
-1,As the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress. pockets  usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.
1,This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.
0,I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however  i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
-1,"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it! had to send back!"
-1,I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.
1,Love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint. the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable.
-1,I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.
-1,Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
1,I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.
-1,"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe"
1,"I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went  but when i ordered mine  there were mostly all good reviews. i absolutely love these lounge pants. someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever  they are certainly very comfortable  not itchy at all. i am 5'6"""" 140 lbs and i ordered the medium. the fit was a little snug at first but  as i wore them  they stretched and loosened. i also wear them with"
1,I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is  as one of the reviewers said  like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress  and the top lays over it  not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped  size 14  and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.
1,What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
0,I really wanted to love this  but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter  this would be a win. nice fabric  not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips.
1,I thought i'd be the first to review for non -size- small ladies... i'm usually between a large and xl in retailer.  the large was great.. with room   as this top is pictured.  you'll love the details on this colorful  fun top ( ex: buttons on the side).  great with skinnies. i bought it on sale  but it really is a special top and worth the price.
0,Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
-1,These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle. i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift.
-1,"This skirt looks cute online but  it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high  this photo is deceptive  look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back."
1,"This cardigan is not my usual color choice  but the details were so beautiful i had to buy it when i saw it at the store. the birds and flowers are detailed with sparkly little beads that are prettier in reality than you can see in these photos. it's also a versatile piece that can be worn in many ways and dressed up or down. i'm only 5'1"" but i didn't need the petite (which is good since it is sold out in petite). the sleeves are cropped so they don't hang too low for me. the sweater is hand wa"
1,This blazer is really well made  it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size  i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!
1,This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!
1,I love this dress so much - the perfect summer dress. comfortable  easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time!
-1,I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.
-1,This top is beautifully made and designed. material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out. i just found it not very flattering for me.
0,"I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8"" and slender  but with a 36' bust  and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit  but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re"
0,"I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately  the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size  i am 5'4""  130 and ordered the 6."
1,The look  quality  and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny.
0,I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.
0,This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great  love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.
1,This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug  but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over  anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise  the top is great and perfect for summer.
1,I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!
1,This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top  and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust  but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend  but know that sizing is off.
0,Let me start off by saying i never write reviews  but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi
0,Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).
0,I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure  but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft  fine silk  but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap  and  with a fixed thin elastic waistband  was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated  the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type  it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!
1,This top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured  nice pattern and could be dressed up or down  the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch   however  the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top  sadly  i think i may send it back.
-1,I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
-1,I ordered the taupe version of this tee  which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough  and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit  which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture  i expected an a-line fit  but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes  and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
-1,"I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are"
-1,"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well  but this one was weirdly big at the top"
-1,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess."
0,"I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped."
0,"I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer  but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy  honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the ""red"" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots  booties  heels  clogs  flats  sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7""  140 lbs and tried the medium."
0,I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately  i was very disappointed when i received it. it is  as a previous person said  very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy  and in my opinion  did not flatter my shape at all. sadly  i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic  or straight and slender  as you suggest.
0,I wanted to love this top  but had 2 major problems with it. first  it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt  which was terribly unflattering. second  the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.
1,I bought this sweater in the green and loved it so much i ended up ordering the pink also. it looks great with jeans or with a pencil skirt. the silhouette is flattering and the sleeves  though big  don't get in the way while i'm working. i'm a little worried about the looseness of the knit and the amount of lint it shed at first  so i don't know how long it will look and feel new. also  one of the buttons on the pink one was hanging by a thread when i first pulled it out of the package. at this
0,Hangs terribly off the chest. tent-like. looks maternity. no thanks.
0,"The fabric and color of this dress is beautiful. two problems with the dress that the picture does not show. 1. it's long. i'm 5'5"". this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length. the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy. i'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom. color and fabric great. but had to send back."
