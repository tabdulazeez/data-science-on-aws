-1,"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately  it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend."
0,The fabric was a beautiful color  but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.
-1,I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
1,"These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans  without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference  i am 5'2""  108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle."
-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.
-1,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.
-1,The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra  no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top  because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package  it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated  it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the
0,This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot)  so i would have liked to size down; however  the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms  maybe you could size down and make this work.
-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.
-1,The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
0,I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
1,Feels great  flows nicely  and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.
1,This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach  and very lovely. as you can see from the photos  the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress  but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green  which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person  which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li
0,I really want to love this dress  the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large  but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy  to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also  it has lining which is nice for modesty  but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining  it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k
1,I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.
1,Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.
-1,This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.
0,I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist  however.
0,I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis
-1,This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l  so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge  i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large  and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is  it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge  hip-y  and bunchy. yuck.
0,"This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit  the fringed part was huge  kind of ""maternity."" i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously  it cannot be altered. so sad  must return."
0,Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
0,"I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9""  32c and i wear 28 size pants  usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
1,This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness  i had to say no. i will watch for sale.
-1,Pretty design  but when i tried it on  the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier  it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
1,This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!
1,This top is fun to wear & looks great with black  grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!
0,In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th
1,These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest  but at the same time  are not too busy. they seem well-made  and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.
0,These are a great casual pants with a lot of style. my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs. i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit  there is at least an inch difference please see photos. i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s.    who is making these pants? can't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa
1,This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!
-1,I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
-1,The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.  now the cons:  this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.
1,I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4  and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'2 and 125 lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!
1,This top is an amazing go to piece  and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say  that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore  it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.
1,I'm 5'5  145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red  medium and love it. yes  it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions  didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is  love
1,Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.
0,"Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6""  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!"
1,This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like  but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale  however! then they're all mine!)  this dress is soft  comfortable  classy  and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape  however  because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o
1,I ordered the red in xs petite  xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far  the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me  however  thought the bag said petite  the actual dresses inside were regular sizes  and they were huge  even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered  this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see  but perhaps this isn't t
0,This is a nice dress  but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .
0,I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
-1,I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i'm dissapointed.
1,I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale  and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice  and you can dress them up or down.
0,I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me
1,This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).
0,True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
0,This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
0,"This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4""  125#  27/4  and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out"
-1,I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.
-1,Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo  this sweater is a faded  boring  teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
-1,I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.
-1,"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone."
0,Love the style and fit  but it does stretch out during wear. by the end of the day  it feels big.
1,I love every other byron lars dress i've bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt
1,This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin  but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!
-1,"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me."
-1,I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
1,I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft  great fabric  a cute cut  and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!
1,Dark burgundy sweater  cable pattern in front (subtle; hard to see online) embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section. beautiful fall sweater.  soft and comfortable. looks great with skinny jeans  would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants.  beautiful color.  slightly roomy fit (not fitted  but not boxy)...true to general size. love this for fall and winter.  flattering  comfortable  unique.
0,"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"
1,I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
-1,I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.
-1,I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all  it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one.     the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
-1,I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it. it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!
-1,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
0,I must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for.  i adored it online and even on the hanger.  putting it on  it just looked frumpy on me (i tried my usual small first).  decided i must need a smaller size  so i sized down to an xs.  this one looked much better on  but was nearly impossible to get in and out of  the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice).  i decided i wasn't willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it.  i passed.
1,I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night  and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm  so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out.
0,This dress has a beautiful color and design. however it runs too big. i'm usually between size 2 or 4 on antropologie's cloths. i had to size down to size 0 to get a more fitted look like the model.
