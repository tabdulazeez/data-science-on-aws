0,This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.
1,I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments. it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night. it is a little long and falls below the knee  but otherwise the dress fits and feels great. the fabric has a nice weight  so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide.
1,"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was  at least for me  a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude  there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down  it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me  but again  i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle  it wouldn't ride up and look more fl"
-1,Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26  so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8 
1,I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color  soft  flowy  fun  practical.
0,"Pros: soft  quality top  true to size  and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder    reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up  and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.    i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures  so as an hour-glass shaped gal  i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a"
-1,I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back. as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on. 10 minutes and 2 broken fingernails later i got done. when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person. so back it goes. even if it had fit  i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons. why they didn't design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
0,"I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good  the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo  the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be  which fall on the seam and when i tried this on  the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre"
1,Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.
-1,I ordered a size large  however as a large  my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.
-1,Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
-1,Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess.
-1,I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately  this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big  it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump  but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
0,I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably  i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room  would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there
1,I absolutely adore this dress! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress. it's effortless  yet still a showstopper. i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me. it's not too tight in the ribcage  yet it is slimming and flattering. not matronly at all! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look  or worn untied for a breezy  casual  a bit more sexy look. i will be wearing this dress
1,I ordered this top online. i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one  i had to have it! i thought the price was great. when i received it  i was impressed with the quality of material. it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops  but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body! i got it in a size small. i do agree with others on here  the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down...but overall...i am truly satisfi
1,This skirt is a keeper. great quality. beautiful color. great fit!
1,Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)  hei hei is my favorite brand of pants  especially their pull on prints.  i am always a medium  these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.  the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on
-1,This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc"
0,"I tried yellow motif  but unfortunately  i did not purchase it.  it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...  i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.  texture was ok.  usually  i like a cool touch of linen.  but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.  i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.  only word i could think was ""average.""  personally  i do not recommend it  but who knows  maybe it is right for you...  so  try wear"
-1,I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
0,"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut  however  it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it."
0,This shirt is adorable  love the lace detail on the sides  but way too boxy for me. it's a great lighter weight for spring  but it doesn't feel flimsy. sadly  there isn't any shape to help make this flattering. it will be returned.
-1,"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short."
1,"It actually is a pretty good t-shirt  but i wish that i had known that ""white"" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like."
0,I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink. the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso  so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s)  it covered my flat hips  fits just like the picture  but now my hips are showing :( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
1,"I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online. turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name.     size: i'm between small and xs for most retailer brands. i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted  so i ordered an xs. i'm 5' 5"" tall  135 lbs  35-29-36  34d  with long torso and narrow shoulders.    fit: xs is spot on for me. i don't really mind the shorter length. it didn't appear to be too boxy. i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w"
-1,Pretty color  but i was hoping for a thicker  higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
0,Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
-1,I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on  the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.   if you have a tiny head and pencil a
0,I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
0,This top is really cute online  but that's about it.  it runs large  but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
-1,I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
1,I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho  flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!
-1,Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
1,This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be! super sexy and great material.
1,Very sweet color   will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .
1,"I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i'm 5' 7.5"" and it's a great tunic length on me. it's really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale!"
1,Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
1,Thicker than you think...the colors are gorgeous and remind you of the changing of the seasons. can not wait to wear when the weather gets cooler. retailer did not disappoint. plan to purchase in other color soon.
-1,I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
-1,This dress is adorable in the photo; however  in reality  it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering  i would have sized down  but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly  i must return.
-1,I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n
1,I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size  and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes  and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size  it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun  and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer  and it is definitely a statement piece.
-1,It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt
1,This sweater is beautiful  but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it's very soft  but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale  and i am glad i didn't pay full price for it--it's lovely  but certainly not worth $88.
1,I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.
-1,I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large  or something? ! i ordered an xs  my usual size  xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose  the upper arms are a bit snug  and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place  but when you look at the model  it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received  and another reviewer  the seam was puffy  making for a strange look. in theory  the shirt should have worked  but didn't. i loved the pattern  not the fit.
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.
0,"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately  the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small  as this coat appears slightly more snug on top  a-line on the bottom  with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back."
0,This is a lovely skirt that fits well  but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also  it felt very static-y.
0,I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length  but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless  billowy and wide  which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment  by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward  but i decided to return the dress.
0,This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
0,The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.
1,Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.
1,I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!
1,This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down  as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!
0,Thought i would love this product  but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.
0,Based on the photos  i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline  fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering  but the fabric is thin and clingy  making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was
0,This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress  wish i had sized down
1,Love this top  you can really fess up  i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds
-1,This looks cute on the model but was way too big  loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs  but returned it. it is an okay black top  nothing great.
-1,"Sadly  going back. ordered m  light color option  very difficult to pull over my head  not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle)  but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l  but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric  it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast""  which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle"
-1,This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
0,It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
0,I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs  36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.    the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as
0,I wanted to love this dress. i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive. when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought. i'm not sure if i misunderstood the images  but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over  i just thought that the fabric had a texture. the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me. i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips  but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am. i think this w
0,"This is as pretty in person as it is online  good quality (except one item i'll get to)  and fits true to size. i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and the medium fit great in this top.  i almost kept this shirt...so close  i had it on a hanger  but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online  but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on  my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
